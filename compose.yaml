      # OPTIONAL: Cron schedule for automatic backups
      # If not set or empty, container will wait for manual commands
      # Examples:
      #   "0 3 * * *"     - Daily at 3am
      #   "0 */6 * * *"   - Every 6 hours

    volumes:
      # REQUIRED: Mount your encrypted bundle file
      - /path/to/your/bundle.tar.enc:/opt/archiver/bundle/bundle.tar.enc

      # OPTIONAL: Mount logs directory for persistence
      - /path/to/logs:/opt/archiver/logs

      # REQUIRED: Mount your service directories that need to be backed up
      # These paths must match what's configured in your config.sh file
      # Example: If config.sh has SERVICE_DIRECTORIES=("/data/services")
      # then you need to mount your host directory to /data/services in the container
      - /path/to/host/services:/data/services

      # Add more service directories as needed based on your config.sh
      # - /path/to/other/data:/other/data

    # Optional: Set container hostname (used in backup snapshot IDs)
    hostname: backup-server
