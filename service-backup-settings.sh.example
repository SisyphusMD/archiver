# Variables for paths to include and exclude in the backup.
# Modify these as needed for your backup configuration.

# ARCHIVE_FILES: Array of files/directories to include in the backup.
# Example: ARCHIVE_FILES=("/path/to/service/directory" "/another/important/path")
ARCHIVE_FILES=(
  # Add paths to backup here. Each path as a new line inside the parentheses.
  # Example: "${SERVICE}/"
)

# EXCLUDE_FILES: Array of files/directories to exclude from the backup.
# Example: EXCLUDE_FILES=("/path/to/service/tempfiles/*" "/path/to/service/logs/*")
EXCLUDE_FILES=(
  # Add paths to exclude from backup here. Each path as a new line inside the parentheses.
  # Example: "${SERVICE}/backups/*.tar"
  # "${SERVICE}/backups/.duplicacy"
)



# Optional Functions for service-specific pre and post backup tasks.
# Define any service-specific commands inside these functions if needed.

# service_specific_pre_backup_function: Function to execute commands before backup.
# This can include service shutdown, data dump, etc.
# Leave empty if no pre-backup actions are required.
service_specific_pre_backup_function() {
  # Add pre-backup commands here.
  # Example: docker compose stop
  :; # No operation placeholder
}

# service_specific_post_backup_function: Function to execute commands after backup.
# This can include service startup, cleanup actions, etc.
# Leave empty if no post-backup actions are required.
service_specific_post_backup_function() {
  # Add post-backup commands here.
  # Example: docker compose start
  :; # No operation placeholder

# Note: The ':;' is used as a placeholder for an empty function body. It's a no-op command in Bash.
