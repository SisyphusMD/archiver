# Backup Variables
# This file is intended to be sourced by a backup script to set environment variables
# and define optional functions for pre and post backup tasks specific to a service.
#
# Usage: source service-backup-settings.sh
#
# Note: This script should not be executed directly but sourced by another script.
# All variables and functions are required to be set. If specific configurations or 
# pre/post backup tasks are not needed, variables can be set to empty strings (""), 
# and functions can contain a no-operation placeholder (:;), except for the SERVICE 
# variable, which must always be set to a valid service name.
#
# Instructions:
# - This configuration file must be named "service-backup-settings.sh" and placed in 
#   every service directory that is listed in the BACKUP_REPOSITORIES variable in the 
#   user-config.sh file. It allows for service-specific backup configurations and tasks 
#   to be defined, ensuring that each service can be backed up according to its 
#   specific needs and requirements.

# Author: Name
# Date: YYYY-MM-DD

# Service name (Required - must always be set to a valid service name)
# Example: SERVICE="example-service" # Replace "example-service" with your actual service name

# Set include/exclude patterns for Duplicacy filter (Required - set to empty if not used)
DUPLICACY_FILTERS_PATTERNS=(
  # Example: "+compose.yaml"
  # "-*"
)

# Optional Functions for service-specific pre and post backup tasks. (Required - use no-operation placeholder if no specific commands are needed)
# service_specific_pre_backup_function: Function to execute commands before backup.
# This can include service shutdown, data dump, etc.
service_specific_pre_backup_function() {
  # Add pre-backup commands here or leave the no-operation placeholder if not needed.
  # Example: docker compose stop
  :; # No operation placeholder
}

# service_specific_post_backup_function: Function to execute commands after backup.
# This can include service startup, cleanup actions, etc.
service_specific_post_backup_function() {
  # Add post-backup commands here or leave the no-operation placeholder if not needed.
  # Example: docker compose start
  :; # No operation placeholder
}
