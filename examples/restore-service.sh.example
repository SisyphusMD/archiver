# restore-service.sh                                                                    #
#   This file is intended to be invoked as the last step of the Archiver restore.sh     #
#   script. It can run any custom bash commands to automate tasks such as bringing up   #
#   a service, restoring database dumps, creating docker networks, or anything you can  #
#   script in bash.                                                                     #
#                                                                                       #
#   Archiver's restore.sh script will return the file contents of the directory to      #
#   their backed up state. Some services require commands be run to restore the service #
#   to its prior functioning state. One example would be a directory containing the     #
#   configuration files for a docker compose project.                                   #
#                                                                                       #
#   In this simple example, the script brings up docker services defined in a compose   #
#   file. This restore-service.sh script would work well if the directory being backed  #
#   up contained all necessary files for a docker compose project, and if bringing up   #
#   that docker compose project were sufficient to return the service to its prior      # 
#   operating state.                                                                    #
#                                                                                       #
#   Many of your directories may not need to use a 'restore-service.sh' file at all,    #
#   particularly those containing only data without services running from that data.    #
#                                                                                       #
# Usage:                                                                                #
#   In any service directory that requires certain commands be run in order to restore  #
#   to its prior operating state, create a file titled 'restore-service.sh', containing #
#   any custom bash script that can run from that environment. This restore-service.sh  #
#   should be included in the directory backup, so that it is available to run after    #
#   repository restore process completes.                                               #
#                                                                                       #
# Note:                                                                                 #
#   This script should not be executed directly. Instead, it will invoked as the last   #
#   step of the Archiver restore.sh script.                                             #
#                                                                                       #
# Instructions:                                                                         #
# - This configuration file is optional. Not all service directories need to run custom #
#   scripts following their restoration.                                                #
# - To use this file, it must be named 'restore-service.sh' and placed in the service   #
#   directory listed in the SERVICE_REPOSITORIES variable in the config.sh file.        #
# - It allows for service-specific restore scripts to be defined and run after file     #
#   restoration, in order to return the service to its prior working state.             #
#                                                                                       #
