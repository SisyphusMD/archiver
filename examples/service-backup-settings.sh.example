# Set include/exclude patterns for Duplicacy filter.
# By default, Archiver will include all files: "+*"
# See https://forum.duplicacy.com/t/filters-include-exclude-patterns/1089 for details.
# Uncomment the below to use.
#
# DUPLICACY_FILTERS_PATTERNS=(
#   # For example: listing +compose.yaml, then -*, will include the compose.yaml file
#   # in the backup, and will exclude all other files and directories.
#   "+compose.yaml"
#   "-*"

# Define service-specific pre-backup functions.
# This can include service shutdown, database dump, etc.
# By default, Archiver will not run any service-specific functions before backup.
# Uncomment the below to use.

# service_specific_pre_backup_function() {
#   # Add pre-backup commands here.
#   # Example: docker compose stop

# Define service-specific post-backup functions.
# This can include service startup, cleanup actions, etc.
# By default, Archiver will not run any service-specific functions after backup.
# Uncomment the below to use.
